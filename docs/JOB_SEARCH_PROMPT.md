**Timeline:**
- Job search to offer: 3-4 months
- Visa processing: 1-3 months
- Total to start: 4-7 months

**Success Rate:**
- Applications → Interviews: 20-30%

### Portfolio as Your Differentiator

**What Makes You Stand Out:**
1. **OR-Tools expertise** - Rare, valuable skill
2. **Production metrics** - Not a toy project
3. **Full-stack capability** - End-to-end ownership
4. **Research rigor** - Academic background

**How to Leverage:**
- Lead with portfolio in resume summary
- Prepare 5-min portfolio presentation
- Have GitHub README ready on tablet for in-person interviews
- Emphasize problem-solving approach, not just tech stack

### Growth Mindset

**First Job Priority:**
- ✅ Company with good mentorship
- ✅ Modern tech stack
- ✅ Growth opportunities
- ✅ Visa stability

**Less Important Initially:**
- ❌ Highest salary (¥500K difference is ~¥40K/month, less important than learning)
- ❌ Brand name (startup experience often better for skill growth)
- ❌ Perfect tech stack match (transferable skills matter more)

**Remember:**
- First job is foundation, not destination
- 1-2 years → mid-level with portfolio + experience
- 3-4 years → senior roles and FAANG possible
- Portfolio gives you head start, not shortcut to senior roles
